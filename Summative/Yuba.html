<center><body>Yuba is a thin beancurd skin collected from the surface of soy milk during the tofu making process. It can be served raw or cooked and has a delicate flavor with a light soybean taste. The texture of raw yuba is sometimes compared to mozzarella cheese, while dried yuba has a slightly chewy texture and is typically fried, boiled, or served in soup. In Nikko, you can try yuba in all kinds of local delicacies, from fried yuba croquettes, to yuba ramen and soba, to even yuba ice cream!</body></center>
