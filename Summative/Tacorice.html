<center><body>This delectable, eponymous Okinawan cuisine consists of everything in its name and then some. Taco rice is a Tex-Mex like dish that is served with taco flavored ground beef, shredded cheese, tomatoes, and lettuce over white rice. It is sometimes served with salsa, in a tortilla roll, and tastes exactly as one would imagineâ€”literally tacos and white rice. It was born and bred in the islands and is one of the most well-known Okinawa food dishes outside of the islands. Since being created by Matsuzo Gibo and served in his cafes beginning in 1984, taco rice has found its way into the hearts and stomachs of locals, expats and tourists alike.</body></center>
