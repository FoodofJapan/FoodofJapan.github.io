<center><body>Hamburgers may be the last item one would expect to be a specialty food in Kyushu. However, as Nagasakiâ€™s Sasebo City has long been home to a U.S. naval base, it should come as no great surprise that Nagasaki has a tradition of old-fashioned, handmade burgers going back several decades. Although there is no official Sasebo burger recipe, some things never change: Sasebo burgers are always generously huge, lip-smackingly greasy and lovingly made to order from local ingredients. Popular varieties include hearty burgers heaped with bacon and fried eggs, as well as massive ground chicken burgers made with poultry from the Kyushu region.</body></center>
