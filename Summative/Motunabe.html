<center><body>Motsunabe, which originated in the Hakata region, is a hot pot of beef or pork tripe. While its main ingredient may sound intimidating to some, don’t let the ingredients get in the way of trying this tasty cuisine. Being high in protein and low in calories, motsunabe is not only delicious but also extremely healthy. In Fukuoka, the tripe is cut into delicate morsels and simmered with cabbage and nira garlic chives until tender, then sprinkled with red chili pepper. Motsunabe is an essential part of Kyushu food culture, especially in the winter, and has gained popularity across Japan in recent years as a dish that helps keep away the cold. Just one taste and you’ll see why.
