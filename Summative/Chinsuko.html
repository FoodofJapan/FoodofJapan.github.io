<center><body>If shortbread or cookies aren’t your thing, then try this specialty instead. These deep fried balls, a novel concoction of beaten eggs mixed with flour and sugar that are also known as Okinawan doughnuts, are a real taste bud turner. They are thick, hearty, and have a similar consistency to hushpuppies. Though they are dense and cakey, you’ll be satisfied by how they crumble in your mouth. If you only take one Okinawan food home with you, make it a box of sata andagi—just try to keep yourself from eating all of them first.</body></center>
