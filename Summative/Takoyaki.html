<center>These little golf ball sized batter balls stuffed with a piece of octopus are perhaps the most famous thing to eat in the city, and they are a big hit and food craze around the world as well.</center>

When you get to Osaka and start wandering around and eating, you’ll be quick to find that at just about every major market there are a few takoyaki vendors… and they are typically some of the busiest restaurants in the entire market.
<br>
<br>
One of the best things about takoyaki is watching them being made.
<br>
It begins with a hot griddle that includes golf ball shaped holes in it. A bunch of pancake like batter is first poured flat into the hot mold, before a pre-cooked piece of octopus is tossed in the middle.
<br>
As the batter becomes partially cooked, and when the chef determines the correct time, the chef takes a duo of chopsticks and works quickly to form the batter into balls, keeping the octopus in the 
center.
