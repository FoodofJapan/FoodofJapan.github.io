<center><body>Yamaguchi prefecture is the best place in Japan to try fugu (pufferfish), the infamous fish which has intestines, ovaries and liver that contain poison a hundred times more toxic than cyanide, and must be prepared only by a specially licensed chef. One of the most popular ways to enjoy this daring food is in the Yamaguchi specialty tecchiri (fugu nabe), a hotpot dish of pufferfish and vegetables simmered in steaming broth. Once you’ve finished all the fish and vegetables, you can add cooked rice and beaten egg to the pot to make a porridge called “zosui” using the fugu-infused broth.</body></center>
