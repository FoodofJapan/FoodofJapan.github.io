<body>I’ll admit and say that I’m not the hugest lover of okonomiyaki. It tastes good sometimes, but to me it’s just kind of like a big pancake, and there’s not that much to it.However, many others,, really love okonomiyaki, and because of its popularity throughout Osaka, it really is something you need to experience when you visit.</body>
<br>
<br>
<Body>Part of the joy of eating okonomiyaki is seeing it being made right before you, and eating it socially with a group of friends.
The batter mixture recipe includes flour, eggs, sometimes dashi stock (dry fish stock), and often a heap of finely shaved cabbage.</Body>
