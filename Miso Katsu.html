<center><body>The popular Tonkatsu dish, which is deep fried pork cutlets served with shredded cabbage and rice, can be found all over Japan. But what makes Nagoyaâ€™s version unique is the thick miso sauce used instead of the traditional tonkatsu sauce. This results in a rich and earthy flavour with a tinge of sweetness that compliments the flavor of the crispy deep fried pork cutlet.</body></center>

To taste this no. 1 local speciality, head to Misokatsu Yabaton - Yabacho Restaurant which has been around for almost 70 years! The winning factor of a perfect plate of miso katsu lies in its traditional miso sauce, which is made from natural soybean miso that takes 18 months to ferment.
