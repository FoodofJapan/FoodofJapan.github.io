<body>Iwate prefecture famous wanko soba challenges any idea of polite and graceful Japanese dining—you’ll have to wear a bib to catch the mess you make! At a wanko soba restaurant, you will be served a small bowl of noodles (wanko means “bowl” in the local dialect)—about the size of just one mouthful—it takes about 15 bowls to equal one regular serving of soba. Your empty bowls are stacked up next to you, and once you finish each round, the staff will refill it with a loud cheer. Obviously, the goal is to slurp down as many bowls of noodles as possible. It’s said the average number of bowls eaten is 50 for women and 60 for men, which means a lot of cheering! You can find wanko soba restaurants across Iwate, served with an assortment of pickles, tuna sashimi, crushed walnuts, mushrooms, wasabi and salmon roe.
